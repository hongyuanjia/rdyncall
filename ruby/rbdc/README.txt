BUILD/INSTALLATION
------------------

1) The extension isn't built here, but its code along with dyncall's source is bundled
   in a .gem file to then be built and installed on the platform where the gem is installed.
   So, you need dyncall's full source code to be included. Unfortunately, the .gemspec isn't
   flexible enough to pull from different paths, so building the .gem file requires dyncall
   to be found next to rbdc.c and extconf.rb. This means either copy dyncall's base directory
   do ./dyncall or create a symlink ./dyncall, that points to it.

2) Then, build this gem with:
   gem build rbdc.gemspec

3) On the target platform, install the gem with:
   gem install ../../../rbdc-*.gem
