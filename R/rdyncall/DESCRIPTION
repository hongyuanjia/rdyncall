Title: Improved Foreign Function Interface (FFI) and Dynamic Bindings to C Libraries (e.g. OpenGL) 
Author: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Maintainer: Hongyuan Jia <hongyuanjia@cqust.edu.cn>
Depends: R (>= 2.4)
Description: The package provides a cross-platform framework for dynamic binding of C libraries using a flexible Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
  The FFI supports almost all fundamental C types, multiple calling conventions, symbolic access to foreign C struct/union data types and wrapping of R functions as C callback function pointers. 
  Dynamic bindings to shared C libraries are data-driven by cross-platform binding specification using a compact plain text format ; an initial repository of bindings to a couple of common C libraries (OpenGL, SDL, Expat, glew, CUDA, OpenCL, ODE, R) comes with the package.
  The package includes a variety of technology demos and OS-specific notes for installation of shared libraries.
