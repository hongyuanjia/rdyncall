Description: Provides a cross-platform framework for dynamic binding of C libraries using a flexible Foreign Function Interface ('FFI').
  The FFI supports almost all fundamental C types, multiple calling conventions, symbolic access to foreign C 'struct'/'union' data types and wrapping of R functions as C callback function pointers.
  Dynamic bindings to shared C libraries are data-driven by cross-platform binding specification using a compact plain text format; an initial repository of bindings to a couple of common C libraries ('OpenGL', 'SDL2', 'Expat', 'glew', 'CUDA', 'OpenCL', 'ODE', 'R') comes with the package.
  The package includes a variety of technology demos and OS-specific notes for installation of shared libraries.
